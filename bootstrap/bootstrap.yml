# Ansible Bootstrap
# =================

# Found on the ansible mailing list and adopted

# Creates the 'ansibler' user and adds him to the 'sudo' group. Then concatenates ansible_rsa.pub to
# the ~/.ssh/authorized_keys on the target instance with group 'sudo'. Then make sure that sudoers is set to allow
# NOPASSWD from sudo, and run everything else with ansible with 'user: ansibler' and sudo:true. This way, all ansible
# activity is logged, and we can specifically revoke the key (and terminate ansible's control) if either
# (a) security is compromised or (b) we hand over control of an instance to a client.
